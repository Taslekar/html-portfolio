<h1>The Best Movie According to Moises</h1>

<h2>My top 3 movies off all-time.</h2>
<hr /> 
<h3>Gladiator</h3>
<p>Gladiator, in my opinion, is the greatest movie to ever be produced in the age of cinema and is not likely to be overshadowed for a great many years. The story is operatic in its foundations but not melodramatic in its deliverance. The actors are all brilliantly cast, with standout performances from Russell Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix, the later portraying evil to its core and absolutely worthy of an academy award. The musical score composed by Hans Zimmer is on another level of perfection, with the theme “Now we are free” performed by Lisa Gerard, to be emotionally breathtaking and heavenly moving to say the least. The director, Ridley Scott, has made some epics in his time but he undoubtedly peaked, pouring all of his talent into this project. That is not to say Scotts brilliance has since been lacking but is intended more to highlight the sheer greatness of his work on this film</p>

<h3>Kingdom of Heaven</h3>
<p>Amazing scenery and incredible writing. Despite it being an older movie, it still manages to deliver impressive scenes combined with an intense and emotional (sometimes truest heartbreaking) narrative.
    There are lots of lessons to be learned which are embodied by the actions desperate people take in a world where good and bad are always in greys. The attention to detail is top level and the acting in incredible. Found myself always wanting to go 15 seconds back just to admire the performance in certain scenes. Every actor expresses their characters emotions wonderfully and all this combined with an incredible soundtrack and marvelous sound design left me impressed. A masterpiece that I recommend.</p>

<h3>Tears of the Sun</h3>
<p>I was surprised a film that is essentially a war flick - something I do not really go in for - came away so well. I for one enjoyed it. I really just picked it off Netflix to see Monica Bellucci (best Bond girl by the way) because I love her foreign films. But Bruce Willis did a pretty amazing job. And while I have no clue who any of the other actors playing the navy seals roles are, they were well worth the watch- especially the one they called “Red”. At least that’s what I thought they called him. As for the soundtrack, well it certainly brought the whole thing together. Very dramatic and completely unexpected. But at the end of the day, for me, it was that first smoldering look between Bellucci and Willis that sucked me in. Talk about love at first snark! LOL.</p>
